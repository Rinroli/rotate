## Rotate
# Educational pet project. Created for fun and to admire the beauty of python.

Some *tkinter* magic - rotating cube and tetrahedron.

Examples (sorry for *gif* artifacts, in the original there are 60 FPS):
![Cube](/examples/cube_example.gif)

![Tetrahedron](/examples/tetra_example.gif)

To run the code, call *main_gui.py* (strange, I know)

    ./main_gui.py
